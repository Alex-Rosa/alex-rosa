Machine learning as a function

Key Terms = Learning, Inferencing, Label, Algorithm, Model, 

Because machine learning is based on mathematics and statistics, it's common to think about machine learning models in mathematical terms. Fundamentally, a machine learning model is a software application that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on one or more input values. The process of defining that function is known as training. After the function has been defined, you can use it to predict new values in a process called inferencing.

The training data consists of past observations. In most cases, the observations include the observed attributes or features of the thing being observed, and the known value of the thing you want to train a model to predict (known as the label).

An algorithm is applied to the data to try to determine a relationship between the features and the label, and generalize that relationship as a calculation that can be performed on x to calculate y. The specific algorithm used depends on the kind of predictive problem you're trying to solve (more about this later), but the basic principle is to try to fit a function to the data, in which the values of the features can be used to calculate the label.

he result of the algorithm is a model that encapsulates the calculation derived by the algorithm as a function - let's call it f. In mathematical notation: y = f(x)

Now that the training phase is complete, the trained model can be used for inferencing. The model is essentially a software program that encapsulates the function produced by the training process. You can input a set of feature values, and receive as an output a prediction of the corresponding label. Because the output from the model is a prediction that was calculated by the function, and not an observed value, you'll often see the output from the function shown as Å· (which is rather delightfully verbalized as "y-hat").
