what is the communication technique to bring up a topic and discuss with someone in a way the person believe they had the idea, but in reality they are following our lead

Ah, this is a classic strategy in communication and psychology often referred to as "planting the seed" or "the Socratic method". The goal is to guide someone towards a certain idea while making them feel like they arrived at it independently. Here’s how you can do it:

Steps to Employ This Technique
Build Rapport: Establish trust and a friendly connection. People are more receptive to ideas from those they trust and like.

Ask Open-Ended Questions: Instead of making statements, ask questions that lead the person to think along the lines you want them to. For example, “What do you think about trying a new approach to this project?”

Active Listening: Show genuine interest in their thoughts and validate their feelings. This helps in making them feel heard and valued.

Provide Gentle Nudges: Casually introduce the topic or idea. Use phrases like “Have you ever considered…?” or “What if we tried…?”

Encourage Exploration: Let them explore the idea. Ask follow-up questions that guide them towards the conclusion you have in mind. For instance, “How do you think this approach could benefit our project?”

Validate Their Insights: When they start leaning towards the idea, affirm their thoughts. This reinforces the belief that they came up with it. Phrases like “That's a great point” or “I hadn’t thought of it that way, but you’re right” can be very effective.

Subtle Reinforcement: Subtly reinforce the idea over time. Reference back to their points in future conversations to strengthen the belief that it was their idea.

Example
Imagine you want a team member to take the lead on a project:

You might start with, “I’ve been thinking about how we could better manage this project. What are your thoughts on ways we could improve our current approach?”

Listen actively to their responses, acknowledging their ideas.

Then, gently nudge, “I remember you did a great job on the last project. Have you considered taking on a leadership role for this one? I think you’d bring a lot of value.”

By following these steps, you’re subtly guiding the conversation and helping them come to the conclusion you had in mind, while they feel it was their idea all along.
