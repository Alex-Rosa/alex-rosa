It was extremely valuable for me to have the opportunity to talk to Alex. Hearing from an experienced professional and being able to ask for advice regarding the daily tasks of an architect will help me a lot in my professional journey. Alex is very clear and straightforward in sharing his knowledge, which is great!
I hope Alex continues to do mentoring sessions so that other people also have the same opportunity I had!

I can’t express enough how much I appreciate your exceptional leadership and immense contributions to SfMC. Your leadership and technical skills have had a tremendous impact on our customers. Thank you for leading the CoE in FY24 to great success. Your mentorship for all TZ leads was outstanding. You always came prepared and planned ahead, and your foresight in training a successor was invaluable. We’ve all learned so much from your experiences.

You’re also an incredible team player. No matter how busy you are, you’re always willing to help when needed, adding immense value to customer engagements and helping others succeed. A rare quality I’ve seen in you is your willingness to share credit honestly and generously. You consistently appreciate the team’s efforts, setting a great example for others to follow.

Thank you again for your remarkable contributions and excellent leadership in WW SFMC engagements. Keep up the fantastic work, and I look forward to continuing this journey together.

Alex, we have known each other for a longtime and it was a pleasure to collaborate with you then and it is a pleasure to collaborate with you even now. I would also like to take this opportunity for all the help you extended to me last year when I was new to SfMC and help me ramp up with the CoE work and with contacts within the team. This was huge help for me in the beginning. As you mentioned, we recently worked together on the TechCommunity blog task and you have kindly accepted to help us in this journey. You have been our key person in the US TZ for this effort and you have put together the initial deck to talk to the CoE lead and offering your insights to ensure it has convincing content. You have also been instrumental in convincing the presales CSA to create the very first blog and went through the cycles of improving the blog until it got published. So thank you for that

Here's a suggestion for how you could leverage this strength further:


In general, you a very friendly approach and for anyone to talk to you would only make it easy to chat/phone you. I am sure your customers also feel the same way which means they have a great and friendly Customer Lead. I am no judge of your technical skill but your friendly approach I feel is your strength. I am not sure you need to improve much on it but keep practicing the same and I am sure you will find it rewarding

I've had the pleasure of working closely with Alex on various projects over the past couple of years, including one of our standout successes: the SfMC WW Readiness Event (FY22-FY23-FY24). This fiscal year, we partnered again to launch the SfMC Tech Community Blog, a project that I believe will greatly benefit our community.

Throughout our collaboration, I have consistently valued Alex’s strategic thinking and clear vision. His ability to bring ideas to life while fostering a collaborative environment is truly commendable. I feel incredibly fortunate to have such an amazing partner in leading initiatives.

Thanks to our collaboration, we developed the SfMC Tech Community Publication Guidelines, published our first blog post, and Alex helped us create the one-slider for our LT presentation. He also took the time to seek feedback on how he could better assist in our efforts, which speaks volumes about his commitment to continuous improvement.

I truly appreciate Alex's willingness to grow, and I’m excited about the potential of our upcoming collaborations. Thank you, Alex, for all that you do! Your leadership makes a significant difference, and I'm grateful to have you as a partner!

Alex, thank you for inviting me to be part of your VBD deliveries. I noticed that you consistently deliver top-notch, in-depth technical presentations. Your insightful listening skills allow you to carefully attend to the details when customers ask questions. I recognize that the Paccar audience isn’t always the most interactive, but you managed to keep them focused and engaged with your material. I’ve learned a lot from your presentation techniques—your pacing, engagement, and how certain sections of your content helped refresh my own skills as well.

hi Alex
I really want to thank you for your assistance this last year.
The breadth and depth of your technical knowledge is proved invaluable this last year.
Each member of the SfMC SQL team has specialization but do stand out for your understanding of the internals.
On top of that, your personal internal network has had real impact.
You were able to connect me with the right person in PG.
Hugo stepped up to address customer asks and to partner with them to further embed Microsoft as their preferred cloud partner.

Thank you very much for assisting,
This is sort of team support and partnering that you evidence every day.

In working with Alex to deliver one of the global Hispanic & Latinx Heritage Month (HLHM) events, Alex was a great team player and decision maker amid a challenging and dynamic environment. Despite limited access to budget or resources, Alex actively sought to find solutions and pivot when needed to. For example, Alex stepped right in when last minute we needed a speaker for the event he was managing, which not only solved a critical gap but also contributed to a better event given his connection with the previous speakers.

I really appreciate all the leadership and initiative that Alex has taken this past year. He has been a key contributor to the SfMC SQL America's team. He has helped to develop new SQL KnowMe Templates, new SQL Discovery assessment, SQL Interviewing and mentoring of new hires (which we had a lot of this past year). Alex has consistently met with me regarding SQL COE activities and sought my input as well as provided me key updates. Alex has initially taken the lead at Deloitte for SQL which has been such a blessing. The person who was assigned as lead was not ready to be lead and Alex filled in for them.

You have always approached customer problem wearing their shoes, think from their perspective and provided excellent support by leveraging the experience you had with ARR. I learnt a lot from you in last few months and will definitely continue to learn while working with you.

I sometimes admire how organized you are, who comes prepared for all the customer meetings. You are spot on in doing what's right for the customer and hope you keep doing that. You were very approachable, responsive , and help the team by sharing the knowledge in both technical and functional areas.

Since we first connected - Alex has been the epitome of technical leadership . I have witnessed Alex jump into different asks and provide insights, industry knowledge, experience and just overall bring the necessary overall assistance needed to push the needle with our customer stakeholders that We supported. He exemplifies the "One Microsoft" concept. Alex is the example of what it means to add - value to the team. His leadership via influence on calls has been demonstrated and witnessed plenty of times. It is that trait that has led to rapid understanding and maintaining focus when conversations can go off track. Alex knows how to ask the right questions that may not have been consider, but adds relevance to the conversation. He knows his stuff and is resourceful with knowing how to navigate to bring the right perspectives and people to the table. BLUF - Alex shines!

Alex has a great background as well as industry experience. Not sure if his or not, but maybe find additional ways to showcase his abilities. My interactions with Alex shows that he is steadfast, resourceful and knowledgeable with our customer stakeholders to move towards their digital transformation. I would love to see him with a team that he is leading directly as I know he has the ability to teach, coach and mentor others to be as successful.

I am absolutely thrilled to provide a perspective for Alex in this connect period. Alex is an active contributor to our global Azure technical community. Each year, we impact greater than $500M in ACR by helping answer hundreds of questions per day from around the world and by providing great technically deep content from our product teams directly to the field. Recently, we embarked on a new initiative - the planning for a content and learning series called "The Semester of Azure" where we plan to bring close to 300 hours of technical training to the field. Alex's leadership in helping secure the participation of product teams, test our new platform for delivery, and close attention to detail is leading the way in getting our strategy to success. Quite simply - without his voluntary efforts, the initiative would not be happening. He is to be commended for this amazing contribution to the success of others!

Alex is very meticulous and customer-centric in our approach. He has done a phenomenal job of managing a few difficult situations in the customer when their Most-Business-Critical Application was constantly getting impacted by a series of issues. He took a conscientious approach of making himself available, addressing all their concerns, closely collaborating with them to resolve all the issues they were facing with their Business-Critical Application. He has gone beyond his role and made himself available to assist customers during critical SQL migrations and avoided major incidents. The customer is very happy to have him as the SQL Lead and feels confident when working with him.

On top of the willingness to help others succeed in their careers, another valuable thing that I've learned from you through our past collaboration on cases is the commitment to our customers and how you advocate for Microsoft culture and products even outside the workspace (via LinkedIn through technical/personal development posts). You are an inspiration for me, thank you for your contribution to my professional growth.

Here's something I think you do really well and hope you keep doing:


Alex, first, I would like to thank you for allowing me to provide my perspective on your incredible support and teamwork thus far. Though it has only been three months, I am very proud to tell you that your support and kindness have been instrumental every step of the way. I have enjoyed every moment of working with you, and I can feel your dedication and energy for Microsoft. In terms of the things you're doing really well, and I would like to break them down for you in more detail.

Microsoft Experience
As a long-time Microsoft employee (8+) years, I can see how you have fully embraced our Microsoft culture of Inclusion and Diversity. You have handled yourself in our interactions with overwhelming strong respect, integrity, and accountability. You have always approached all situations with a growth mindset and welcomed the ideas of everyone. You answered all my silly questions due to being so new with SQL Mi. You have helped our entire Team continue to grow, learn, and better support our customers. You have inspired everyone around you to be courageous, curious, and learn all that we can about SQL Mi.

Technical Experience
As I am sure you know, your SQL Mi experience has been our customers' most critical and fundamental need. Your long history and work experience in this area have proven to be super helpful. You have already joined many customer-facing meetings and CritSits, successfully providing deep insights into the problem at hand. In one case recently, I remember you were able to identify the problem and calm the customer completely. From your many previous roles, It is clear that you indeed have the rich technical experience that can provide critical help when our SfMC customers need it. Your presence on our customer-facing calls helps us build trust and confidence with our customers while also guiding them on the path of success in Azure.

Love for the customers
Another thing I have noticed in the three months working closely with you is your love for our clients and the organizations they are working to support. On every customer-facing call, you have spoken with a tone of kindness, support, and excitement to get the customer the answer they need. You are super proactive in looking into possibilities before calls and suggesting things to prepare me for possible outcomes better. You appear to genuinely love what you are doing and personally care about our customer's success. I think your love for your role flows to our customers at Support for Mission Critical.

Proactive works
Aside from being proactive with your work and our customer's needs, I can see that you are also proactive with your personal development. I understand that you are pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity (Information Assurance). It is clear to me that you are on a path both personally and professionally for success. Being focused on personal and professional goals and having a straightforward way for yourself is a beautiful indicator of success. You demonstrate this and seem very eager to motivate those around you for the same.

Supportive and helpful nature
In our short time together, you have already helped me personally in many ways. Taking me aside in Team's meetings and showing me how to do things like: "Set up alerts to inform our customers of maintenance activities better is just one example of many." You have great patience in your supportive works, and you have never made me feel like I could not come to you with a question. You have an enjoyable and personable support style which I admire very much.

Here's a suggestion for how you could leverage this strength further:


As I have not got to know all of the things you are doing inside and outside Microsoft, I have very few suggestions in this area as you may already be doing these things. One direction would be to leverage your excitement and passion for SQL Mi and set up learning calls for team members like myself who are not as well versed. I am sure, given the time, that you could develop learning modules or labs to help better our Team understand SQL Mi.

Additionally, if you get any opportunities to give talks for Microsoft such as AGM or possible public speaking engagements regarding Azure and SQL Mi. I think you would be very successful as a person from Microsoft to speak publicly about our technology.

You can drive this relationship, pressing your mentor for regular meetings to dive into tough cases or gain depth in specific areas like debugging, performance analysis, etc. It will help you get finer skills and learn tips and tricks to navigate to long term success in our extremely complex role. It will benefit your mentor too, and help them fulfill the extra requirements of their role outside the casework they do, and they will also likely learn from you in the process too, so it is win/win for both parties.

The level of knowledge, not only the high level of technical expertise around SQL, Azure, Data & AI, but the internal processes along with strong leadership tremendously helped navigate me to be able to quickly learn at this job. I feel there is no holdback when come from you. You gave me all the answers that I inquired with additional supplement documents and videos. I loved that you have some tips and techniques that you developed on your own and you are willing to share that knowledge with me. I feel learning so much quicker and being able to get on faster at my job coming from a new hire perspective not knowing much about MS processes. This surely gave me a lot of confidence and assuring me to do things right follow your directions. I admired some of the breakdown details on how you track your time, and how you built that into Power BI. That is cool but not a lot of people think of doing that and I will definitely be using that method as well. I have been really enjoying and absorbing a lot of new knowledge from you.

The thing I most value about working with you is:


You observe each engineer good work and recognize their work. One example is sending a quick Kudos to appreciate engineer good work. It really inspires engineers to go to an extra mile and help the team when the team is looking for help. You take time to listen others and give your honest feedback. You understand engineer career aspirations and you provide all the resources that you think help engineer to reach their career goal whether it could be techincal or non-technical. Thanks for being my TA!
