Prompt:
What impact did you have for each of your core priorities?
Employee Response:
Fiscal Year 2025 began with unprecedented uncertainty in my nearly twelve-year tenure at Microsoft. Yet, it evolved into one of the most rewarding starts to a fiscal year.    

I attribute this to my well-known growth mindset and my ability to adapt my career as needed. Crucially, the feedback from my 1:1 meetings with my manager, Daniel Siffredi, has been pivotal. His insights fill gaps, reveal blind spots, and fuel my growth mindset, empowering me to continuously reinvent myself amid the industry's constant changes and innovations.    


Here’s an overview from July to October 2024:

1- Compliance

RCA: 100% completed   

Training: 100% completed   

Labor Logging: 100% on-time  

  

2- Empower customers to realize business value 

Contribution to the business and customer results.   


(JOB 1 – Driving to Complete ~ US$103,100.00)   
Four Value Based Delivery (VBDs) delivered, one of the customers’ examples:   

PACCAR is a global technology leader in the design, manufacture and customer support of premium light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. I conducted three Value Based Deliveries focused on Azure SQL Managed Instance Essentials, Security, and Performance.   


IMPACT
These sessions, conducted in September 2024, were pivotal in PACCAR’s Upskilling plan, facilitating the upcoming migration of PACCAR's on-premises SQL Server instances to Microsoft Azure. The positive feedback from PACCAR employees during the delivery and CSAM attests to the significant learning and tangible benefits that will directly support their migration project commencing in early 2025.   

In CSAM’s words: “You are an expert in your technology with amazing customer facing skills. I love the way you customize your work based on customer scenarios. By Sivagami Manoharan (Sr CSAM) on 10/01/2024”.   

   

3- Deliver differentiated customer experiences

Contribution to the business and customer results and contributing to the success of others. 

During a VBD scoping call I uncovered a customer need for a technology out of my domain. Then, I have decided to invite one of our SfMC CSA to partner with me in order to deliver an excellent experience. 


Here's the results shared with Jayaraj Yella on 8/26/2024 regarding Renato Pacheco collaboration:

IMPACT
I would like to highlight Renato’s contribution to IBGE, one of our valued Microsoft customers.  

I invited Renato to collaborate with me because many of the customer’s questions were related to Microsoft Intune, SCCM, and Azure Arc.  

After a few hours of discussion, we successfully addressed all their questions, focusing on enhancing their current automation to achieve greater resilience and security through Microsoft updates.  

As a result:  

We accomplished approximately 13.5% of the Committed Milestones for this account.  
Two new engagements, already approved by the customer, were initiated due to our meeting. These new engagements will contribute an additional 25% towards the Committed Milestones.  
Who is the IBGE?  

In the United States, the equivalent agency to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) is the United States Census Bureau.  

The Census Bureau is responsible for collecting and analyzing demographic, economic and social data, including conducting a population census every ten years, similar to what the IBGE does in Brazil.  

  

4- Drive operational excellence​

Repeatable Delivery: 48.1%   

SfMC Know-Me: Monthly checking in and updating as needed.

Participation in weekly SCRUMs meetings with Interactive Communication CSAs, customers, and CSAM.  

Weekly following up my customers’ consumption and logging in my labor notes gives me insights about consumption trends with opportunities to discuss with the Customer Solution Leads possible actions.

Customers Health Consumption/Operational Burn: CIBC (~59%), Deloitte (95%), InComm (174%) 
  
5- Lead AI Transformation at scale 

Leveraging my colleague’s knowledge and ideas that helps me to achieve better results.

I am fortunate to be one of the few and possibly the first SfMC CSA to complete the Flight Plan: Azure AI - Data & AI Cloud Solution Architect.

Also, I have completed many other training courses, such as: AI Foundations in FY25, Fundamentals of Azure OpenAI Service, etc.  


6- Enable high quality and impactful SfMC outcomes

Contribution to the business and customer results and contributing to the success of others. 


Considering the company's peer feedback average lower than ten per fiscal year, with a high average of sixteen peer feedback responses per fiscal year and gotten five peer feedback up to today. It’s clear to see my desire and impact on the success of others. 


IMPACT
In one of my VBD deliveries, Supatra Siritanabodeekul (Sr CSA), participated as a Shadow Resource giving her real experience and about eight billable hours.   

In Supatra’s words (Summarized with Copilot): “Alex's technical presentations, attentive listening, and engaging delivery kept the Paccar audience focused. I've learned a lot from him. By Supatra Siritanabodeekul (Sr CSA) on 10/03/2024”.   


SfMC Data & AI Center of Excellence:   

A- Nominated by the WW Data & AI CoE lead as one of the points of contact for Discovery Assessment Guides along with Sundar, Chandra, and Dharmendra (see PDF attached for details).   

B- Frequently conversation with Ravipriya De Alwis and Supatra Siritanabodeekul answering their questions, sharing my experiences, and providing guidance if necessary (see PDF attached for details).  

 

Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Core Priority

Security Core Priority
Prompt:
What impact did your actions have in contributing to a more secure Microsoft? You can still capture progress even before you set your Security Core Priority for the first time.
Employee Response:
1- Reducing risk

A- Upon learning about the Secure Future Initiative, I decided to unenroll my personal cell phone from being a company device with access to Microsoft’s internal resources. Since I don't use my personal phone for work emails or file access, this change seemed appropriate. When I need to work outside of business hours, I can easily access everything I need on my company laptop.

B- Actively reporting phishing or junk emails with more than thirty emails/domains reported so far. 

 

2- Upskilling

A- Obtaining a second degree since January 2023
Degree: Associate of Applied Science
Majors: CIT - Cyber Security (Cyber Defense Specialization)
The Cyber Defense specialization combines both networking and systems administration fundamentals with a focus on defensive strategies to securing networks and systems. 


B- Taking internal training, such as: Security Foundations Prioritizing Security Above All Else, Trust Code, Microsoft Security Customer Conversations Foundations, Introduction to the Secure Future Initiative for MCAPS, etc.

Thank you for taking the time on putting your connect notes on such great formatting, it makes it easier to read and follow. here's my assessment.

1 Compliance, you've been on top of everything needed in regard to this core priority, in fact you also facilitated heads up to the team when it comes to mandatory training, leading the way. thanks!

2 Empower customers realize value, you've delivered VBDs helping Paccar (not SfMC) realize value facing their migration from onprem SQL with great feedback from customer and CSAM.

3 Deliver differentiated customer experiences, your collaboration with Renato Pacheco @IBGE (not SfMC) helped this customer improve their processes and increase security and resiliency. Well done!

4 Drive OpEx. Very strong repeatable delivery with 46%, customer burn can be better @CIBC but we know the circumstances that are driving this and are beyond your control, the rest of your customers show a solid contract consumption, RCAs and Labor logging all good here as well.

5 Lead AI Transformation, you've completed Flight Plan Azure AI - Data & AI Cloud Solution Architect,
and other trainings as: AI Foundations in FY25, Fundamentals of Azure OpenAI Service, etc. This indicates you are investing on this core priority to lead the way in the future. Looking forward to seeing tangible impact on this area by the end of this FY. Well done so far Alex.

6 Enable high quality SfMC outcomes, great feedback received from peers showcasing your willingness to contribute to the success of others on things like coaching and mentoring or shadowing.
Your contributions also are being noticed by Data & AI CoE becoming a SME for Discovery Assessments on your field of expertise.
You're making impactful decisions in reducing risk and upskilling.

D&I Contributing to the success of others
Thanks, Alex, for your contributions on these two fronts, #1 MCAPS Career Shaper Program, you're contributing to career development improving programs, promoting resources, fostering a growth mindset, and advocating for inclusivity.
#2, as a member of the HR/Benefits Be Well Champions, you've promoted wellbeing resources and encouraged colleagues to improve their wellbeing. The Be Well Games 2024 was a success with 101 participants from 19 countries, totaling 163K minutes of activity.
Your efforts in both areas have positively impacted your colleagues and the broader community.

Security Core Priority
For reducing risk, you are aligning with the Secure Future Initiative. You also reported over thirty phishing and junk emails, enhancing security. Well done!
In upskilling, you're pursuing an Associate of Applied Science degree in CIT - Cyber Security (Cyber Defense Specialization) since January 2023. Additionally, you've completed various internal training courses, demonstrating your commitment to continuous learning and professional development.

With all that said, excellent start of the FY and I'm very looking forward to seeing how your impact on these core priorities develops further along the year. good job Alex!
Reflect on a challenge or setback

In addition to your accomplishments relative to your core priorities, you must demonstrate a growth mindset to deliver successful impact. Share how you demonstrated a growth mindset by taking personal accountability for setbacks, asking for feedback, and applying learnings to have greater impact.
Prompt:
Consider when you could have done something differently. How will you apply what you learned to make an even greater impact?
Employee Response:
Over the past two years, I've emphasized the importance of strong communication skills, especially post-COVID-19 with many colleagues working from home. Building healthy relationships and strong bonds has become more challenging.

The CIBC incident, discussed in my last connect, highlights areas for better communication. Though not all points directly relate to my role, I take responsibility for how some colleagues perceived me as a resource on the account.

My frustration with the account management and lack of impactful opportunities for my technology affected me more than I anticipated. What seemed like a wise decision to skip unproductive meetings due to a lack of relevant opportunities became a complaint, as my colleagues expected full engagement from everyone, even if just on standby.

From this, I learned the importance of non-verbal communication and hope my colleagues will also provide constructive feedback promptly, so we can grow together as a team.

FY25:  

Overall, please continue to align your own work and personal goals within our Mission Critical Delivery priorities and with the defined core priorities across the 3 circles of impact. Our Mission Critical customers and business should always be at the centre of everything you do.    

High focus on high quality and impactful SfMC outcomes:   

Drive consumption metrics on your accounts by paving the way for cloud adoption and use.  
Special focus on resiliency and security for the SfMC workloads you support, whether OnPrem or in the Cloud.  
Collaborate with Account Teams (Job 1) to uncover opportunities for growth and renewals.  
Enhance and help land milestones (Job 2) through delivery and service reviews focusing on Repeatable Delivery.  
Proactively meet customer business needs and deliver measurable value, recognized through positive customer feedback, customer success stories, customer wins, and a 100% renewal rate.  
Achieve operational excellence through high-quality delivery and efficient service for our customers, e.g., through excellent onboarding experiences (within 42 days), good quality updated Know-Me every 60-90 days, and overall good reactive and proactive experience for the Mission Critical workloads, with a Proactive Burn rate of over 90%.  
Support colleagues by participating in communities like CoE, mentorship, and sharing innovative practices.  
Share best practices with Success Stories widely and help improve the practice by delivering consistent value. Support the success of others, e.g., by nominating your peers for awards.  
  

Empower customers to realize business value  

In short, focus on Job1/2, UCR consumption and CSP contribution and execution   
  

Deliver differentiated customer experiences  

Operate as “One Microsoft” for success through active engagement and contribution to CSP and Consumption plans. Prioritize repeatable IP/VBD’s (WAF/WASA/WARA) and complete regular customer services reviews and a minimum of X DHR’s per SfMC customer, yielding a minimum of X customer success stories per year.  
 
Drive operational excellence  

Continue/develop the operational rigor with Job 1 & Job 2 and focus on successful collaboration with Account Teams. Leverage CoE Lead perspectives for CoE engagement, impact and share best practices with others.

Prompt:
What impact did you have for each of your core priorities?
Employee Response:
I am finishing Fiscal Year 2024 with great achievements.

 

Highlights:

CIBC and Scotiabank Customer Success Stories (please see attachments),
Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month 2023 (Organizer and Facilitator of Leading with Latinidad event),
My colleagues' official feedback,
WW SfMC Data & AI CoE Lead position,
Microsoft Azure SQL Insider Program.
 

Empower customers to realize business value. 

 

Accomplishment:

NOTE: Support files attached.

In January 2023, I attended a CIBC meeting when Sorin Neagoie (Senior Director at CIBC) raised a technical blocker. Microsoft Azure SQL Maintenance Window options don't meet the CIBC business requirement regarding start and end time. Leveraging my knowledge of Azure SQL products and how Microsoft Program Managers work, I offered to CIBC to meet with one of our Program Managers. After discussing and developing a new offer, Scott Kim (Principal Program Manager at Microsoft) confirmed on September 2023 that we can support CIBC requirements starting in February 2024. 

 

Impact:

A brand-new Azure SQL Database infrastructure was deployed in order meet the hardware and capacity required, resulting in a brand-new Azure SQL DB Maintenance feature, initially only for CIBC, but other customers around the world will have the benefits soon.

 

Balancing the need for uninterrupted production services with essential maintenance tasks.

 

The proposed new maintenance window (12AM Sunday to 11:59PM Sunday Local time) released in February 2024 is a significant improvement over today’s options.

 

In customer words: “We are grateful for the new maintenance window. Overall, this new maintenance window will improve the resilience of our systems and decrease the operational risk. Sent by Sorin Neagoie (Senior Director | Capital Markets Enterprise Solutions) on 12/5/2023 via e-mail”

 

 

Deliver differentiated customer experiences. 

 

Contributing to the Success of Others:

I had the privilege to work with great professionals helping them to achieve more.  Nine of them shared their feedback, they are from distinct roles, teams, and regions.

 

Impact:

Only three examples in my colleagues' words:

 

"...connecting me with relevant stakeholders..." by Melania Nitu (SfMC CSA EMEA)

 

"... You were able to connect me with the right person in PG..." by Surdeep Sharma (SfMC Sr CSA Americas)

 

"...You took the accountability to organize the event and took it to be a success..." by German Ordonez (Principal Program Manager)

 

 

Contributing to the Success of Others:

In FY24, I was selected as the Worldwide Data & AI SfMC CoE Lead, working with the regional leads Andre Rodrigues, Jad Salloum (replaced by Yigit Aktan in January 2024), Masaaki Ide, and Ravipriya De Alwis.  

 

Impact:

Leading Data & AI CoE, we were able to empower our global Data & AI colleagues helping them understand the Value-Based Delivery (VBD) and Azure AI options we have, how to prepare and get accreditation, and, consequently, deliver a better customer experience. 

  

Leveraging Others Work:

NOTE: Support files attached.

In FY24 I joined the Microsoft internal program Azure SQL Technical Insiders.

The Technical Insiders must have a deep level of technical expertise in how to assess, design and implement SQL as part of multiple application architectures. They have demonstrated technical mastery through a comprehensive multi-month program, which includes deep technical training, knowledge checks and certification.

 

Impact:

Working closely with Microsoft Program Group I had the opportunity to get involved in important Engineering programs, such as Enterprise Voice, and I was able to nominate important customers to participate in, such as Deloitte and CIBC.

Enterprise Voice is a customer advisory program established with the goal of making the Microsoft data cloud – including Microsoft Fabric, Power BI and Databases (incl. SQL products, Azure MySQL, Azure PostgreSQL and Azure Cosmos DB) – a better platform for enterprise databases, business intelligence, and analytics scenarios through ongoing engagement with key strategic stakeholders from top enterprise customers.

 

 

Drive operational excellence​. 

 

Contributing to the Success of Others:

In FY24Q1, I was a technical mentor for Anya Mendenhall and a career mentor for Supatra Siritanabodeekul. Also, I coached Shay Patel (SQL Ninja Engineering team) on her journey to get SQL certifications and Renato Pacheco (SfMC) on his journey to a possible career transition focusing on Data and AI. 

 

Impact:

Anya and Supatra understood the topics discussed and can already put them into practice with their customers and colleagues. Anya improved her troubleshooting and Azure AI skills, and Supatra learned leadership concepts and actions. 

  

Leveraging Others Work:

I have worked with a Principal CSA from HLS in order to close some gaps regarding Healthcare industry. Also, I signed up for the external coaching sessions with EZRA in order to have an external point of view regarding focusing on a specific industry rather than being a hybrid professional.

 

Impact: 

The healthcare mentorship helped me to understand the industry requirements from the Microsoft CSA perspective, and I was able to identify the gaps I had. Also, I realized that since I am not working within a Pre-Sales team, the most important skill is technical and not the industry knowledge, even if industry knowledge may help me to navigate better.

 

 

Compliance. 

 

Individual Accomplishment:

100% of all required training completed. Including Azure OpenAI in a Day, Azure AI Day, and eighteen additional training.

100% on-time labor.

100% SfMC RCA SLA met. (discontinued)

 

6 VBD/MIP - 2 Delivered and 4 Upcoming (FY24)

 

Impact:

Improved my Azure AI knowledge, preparing me to start working on my Azure AI certifications.

I have not listed VBD as a highlight because since we don't have official Customer Surveys for that, even that I know the two deliveries were I success, I don't have tangible results to support the impact. I am working with the VBD Program Managers and CELA to see if I can create a customized Survey and send it out to the customer at the end of the delivery.

I had the privilege to be invited to organize one of the Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month 2023 events. Initially I was supposed only to organize, but our facilitator (General Manager of Portugal) was not able to participate, and I was asked if I would like to take this role in addition to my Organizer role. I accepted the challenge, and the event was a success. 

 

Event date: September 21st, 2023

 

Leading with Latinidad # of RSVP'd: 416

Manager comments
Thank you, Alex, for your time, and dedication to your peers and customers. I'd like to highlight some of the impacts you've made.

Direct Impact/Teamwork: Your core operational excellence and compliance metrics are good, well done.

   - VBDs (Value-Based Deliverables): 6 VBDs in FY24 (2 delivered/4 upcoming)
   - Ontime labor 100%.
   - Contributed to CIBC and Scotia Bank Success Stories.
   
CIBC: Alex proactively addressed a technical blocker during a CIBC meeting, leading to the deployment of a new Azure SQL Database infrastructure. This enhancement benefits not only CIBC, but also other customers worldwide by introducing an improved maintenance window receiving great customer feedback and thanks!

Now I have also received feedback about strengths and missed opportunities on CIBC: 
Alex possesses recognized strengths such as technical expertise and a commitment to maintaining robust and reliable services. His profound knowledge of cloud solutions is instrumental in our technical operations and is highly valued by both our team and customers.
However, there are areas where Alex could improve. His accountability and ownership in managing tasks and responsibilities need enhancement, particularly in driving customer engagement. His tendency to leave bi-weekly customer calls early due to conflicting appointments suggests a need for better time management.
Additionally, Alex should be more proactive in anticipating and preparing for customer needs. He has missed opportunities to develop a robust proactive plan for the workloads he leads. Regularly reviewing technological trends and strategizing to address potential challenges in CIBC's roadmap or suggesting technological advancements would be beneficial.

Contribution to the success of others:

As the Worldwide Data & AI SfMC CoE Lead, Alex collaborated with regional leads to empower global Data & AI colleagues. By providing insights into Value-Based Delivery (VBD) and Azure AI options, Alex facilitated better customer experiences.

Leveraging the work of others:

Alex joined the Microsoft internal program Azure SQL Technical Insiders. By collaborating closely with the Microsoft Program Group, Alex participated in important engineering programs, including Enterprise Voice. Through this engagement, Alex nominated significant customers like Deloitte and CIBC to participate. Enterprise Voice aims to enhance the Microsoft data cloud platform for enterprise databases, business intelligence, and analytics scenarios by engaging with strategic stakeholders from top enterprise customers.

D&I 
Alex was initially invited to be organizing one of the Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month 2023 events. Initially assigned as an organizer, Alex stepped up to facilitate the event when the General Manager of Portugal couldn’t participate. The event was a success, with impressive attendance, diverse speakers, and an outstanding conversion rate. 

Thank you very much again for all your time an efforts Alex.

Employee Response:
Value Delivery Based (VBD), last year I started asking for opportunities to deliver VBD for non-SfMC customers to put in practice my skills and be able to make the time invested in VBD training worth.

In the beginning of 2024 (calendar year) I was told that we have approval to accept requests for non-SfMC customers and I already have six in my history since January 2024.

This experience will help me to deliver a better experience for our SfMC customers when the time comes.

Manager comments
Alex took the opportunity to leverage his learnings on VBD and deliver to customers outside SfMC, which allowed him to flex the delivery muscle on VBDs to be better prepared for SfMC customers when needed. 
We talked about the fact that flexibility when it comes to VBD, and SfMC customers can be a double edge sword, some customers take too much time to respond or get things done and in fact that becomes a "liability" in terms of VBD delivery and value to the customer. 
One call out here that was highlighted above are areas for improvement. Shared by CIBC DTU Manager and discussed with Alex.
Alex possesses recognized strengths such as technical expertise and a commitment to maintaining robust and reliable services. His profound knowledge of cloud solutions is instrumental in our technical operations and is highly valued by both our team and customers.
However, there are areas where Alex could improve. His accountability and ownership in managing tasks and responsibilities need enhancement, particularly in driving customer engagement.

Manager comments
Alex, please continue to align your own work and personal goals within SfMC with your core priorities across the 3 circles of impact. Our SfMC customers and business should always be at the center of everything you do.  
 
Customer Empowerment and Business Value Realization: Boost SfMC account consumption through cloud adoption. Ensure efficient and quality onboarding (42 days or less), regular quality know-me updates (updated every 30-60 days), and timely RCA completion with a focus on 100% consumption of proactive line items in the contract (PBR).
Deliver a differentiated customer experience: Follow SfMC documented processes for reactive support & reduce reactive efforts, prioritize Customer Success Plan contribution, prioritize the delivery of reusable IP/VBD's/(WAF) and participate in account team and customer discussions with CSAMs.
 
Conduct regular Customer-Facing Service Reviews and Internal Delivery Health Reviews.
Drive Operational Excellence: Actively contribute to CoE activities, share best practices, build off the work of others and publish at least 2 quality customer success stories per year. Leverage CoE Lead perspectives of CoE engagement and impact.
Promote Diversity & Inclusion and focus on Accessibility: Make sure to contribute to an inclusive spirit honoring diversity and focusing on your personal D&I measures for success. Thank you for your focus on Accessibility, an additional focus could be landing these topics with our customers.
Integrity: Uphold ethical behavior, adhere to compliance policies, and report any discrepancies promptly.
 
Your dedication to these areas is appreciated.

Prompt:
What impact did you have for each of your core priorities?
Employee Response:
I started Fiscal Year 2024 with some achievements and the potential to do even better in the rest of the fiscal year.

Highlights: WW SfMC Data & AI CoE Lead position and Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month 2023 (Organizer and Facilitator of Leading with Latinidad event)

           Empower customers to realize business value. 

Individual Accomplishment:

In January 2023, I attended a CIBC meeting when Sorin Neagoie (Senior Director at CIBC) raised a technical blocker. Microsoft Azure SQL Maintenance Window options don't meet the CIBC business requirement regarding start and end time. Leveraging my knowledge of Azure SQL products and how Microsoft Program Managers work, I offered to CIBC to meet with one of our Program Managers. After discussing and developing a new offer, Scott Kim (Principal Program Manager at Microsoft) confirmed on September 2023 that we can support CIBC requirements starting in January 2024. 

Impact:

The new maintenance window significantly reduced the global organization risk from high to low for operations in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia (Australia, China, Japan). 


Contributing to the Success of Others:
As a Customer Backup Lead, I reach out to the Customer Solution Lead I am working with, offering my assistance and asking if they need help with their Solution Lead tasks, such as RCAs and Know-Me updates. 

Impact:

CIBC and InComm, making sure the SfMC contract burn rate is in a healthy state. For InComm, I completed on-time three required RCAs and submitted two for Good Quality selection. Also, I have completed seven InComm RCAs as Not Required due to being out of SfMC scope. 

  

Leveraging Others Work:

In September 2023, I attended a CIBC meeting when Geani Nedelcu (Director of Application Services at CIBC) raised concerns about Azure SQL performance. After carefully listening to Geani explain what they are facing, I realized that one of Microsoft's offerings (TSPR) and I explained how the offer works and gave them my recommendations. After the meeting, Geani confirmed their interest, and they already have CIBC leadership approval to proceed with the TSPR delivery. With the customer confirmation, we engaged Bob Taylor (Principal CSA and TSPR lead) to work with us. 

Impact: 

CIBC will consume one of the proactive VBD/MIPs included in their contract, and on top of that TSPR will analyze all their application code available comparing to a list of more than seven hundred known vulnerabilities and points of improvement. As a result, a report will be generated classifying our findings in High, Medium, and Low. 





Deliver differentiated customer experiences. 



Contributing to the Success of Others:

In FY24, I was selected as the Worldwide Data & AI SfMC CoE Lead, working with the regional leads Andre Rodrigues, Jad Salloum, Masaaki Ide, and Ravipriya De Alwis.  

Impact:

Leading Data & AI CoE, we will be able to empower our global Data & AI colleagues to help them understand the Value-Based Delivery (VBD) and Azure AI options we have, how to prepare and get accreditation, and, as a consequence, deliver a better customer experience. 

  

Leveraging Others Work:

In July 2023, Praise Iyamu (Microsoft Vendor) delivered a SQL Performance Tuning workshop to InComm. During the workshop, the InComm team mentioned they were happy with the training but still had technical questions. Once I heard that, I offered InComm a series of specialized brown bags tailor-made for their outstanding questions. Nalini Kotamraju (SQL DBA Manager at InComm) liked the offer, and she asked us to work with her on that. 

Impact: 

Tailored-made skilling plan delivered in multiple short sessions. Improving the customer DBA team skills and possibly reducing the number of reactive cases InComm open with Microsoft. 





Drive operational excellence​. 



Contributing to the Success of Others:

In FY24Q1, I was a technical mentor for Anya Mendenhall and a career mentor for Supatra Siritanabodeekul. Also, I coached Shay Patel (SQL Ninja Engineering team) on her journey to get SQL certifications and Renato Pacheco (SfMC) on his journey to a possible career transition focusing on Data and AI. 

Impact:

Anya and Supatra understood the topics discussed and can already put them into practice with their customers and colleagues. Anya improved her troubleshooting skills, and Supatra learned leadership concepts and actions. 

  

Leveraging Others Work:

InComm asked Microsoft to give a Microsoft Fabric presentation because they would like to explore this new service more. Once I heard that, I reached out to one of my friends, Freddie Santos (Microsoft Fabric Senior Program Manager), who delivered an excellent presentation to InComm. 

Impact: 

InComm loved the presentation and all the questions answered. Now, they are more prepared to start working with Microsoft Fabric and some projects they already have. On top of that, Sebastian Iglesias (Dir Specialist at Microsoft) leveraged our efforts and delivered the same presentation to other customers. 





Compliance. 



Individual Accomplishment:
100% of all required training completed. Including Azure OpenAI in a Day, Azure AI Day, and eighteen additional training.

100% on-time labor.

100% SfMC RCA SLA met.

Impact:

Improved my Azure AI knowledge, preparing me to start working on my Azure AI certifications.

Alex, thank you for your reflection on the first quarter of this fiscal year.

 

You've had an excellent start of the year, and I'm excited to see what you continue to do and how much impact you continue to make this fiscal year. You've already received some great feedback from your peers including:

Your ability to explain complex topics clearly and your dedication to sharing your knowledge stands out. I deeply appreciate the time you've taken to mentor me, especially in the nuances of being a Customer Lead and guiding me through training and growth opportunities.
He has been a key contributor to the SfMC SQL America's team. He has helped to develop new SQL KnowMe Templates, new SQL Discovery assessment, SQL Interviewing and mentoring of new hires (which we had a lot of this past year). Alex has consistently met with me regarding SQL COE activities
You have a true desire to help others and regularly share informative articles about new releases or process enhancements. I appreciate how accessible and responsive you are, regardless of whether I reach out via email or instant messaging. Your extensive knowledge and enthusiasm for helping others have made a profound impact, and I greatly value your contributions.
 

As you already know, maintaining delivery and operational excellence will be of utmost important this year. Please ensure that you're continue to meet these expectations throughout the year. Some insights on your progress thus far:

RCA: 100% Completed On-Time
Contribution to Time Zone Utilization: 65.6%
Training: 100%
Labor Logging: 100%
 

It's great to see the impact you're already making, especially to the three circles of impact. Some highlights from your reflections that stood out to me:

Demonstrating the leader, you are with your roles as the CoE WW Lead for Data & AI and facilitator of the leading with Latinidad event!
Reducing a huge organizational risk with your work in CIBC and impacting worldwide.
Continuing your mentorship of others, including Anya Mendenhall, because now it's about how you make others better.
 

Thank you for a great first quarter. Let's continue to drive this impact and have a great FY24!

In addition to your accomplishments relative to your core priorities, you must demonstrate a growth mindset to deliver successful impact. Share how you demonstrated a growth mindset by taking personal accountability for setbacks, asking for feedback, and applying learnings to have greater impact.
Prompt:
Consider when you could have done something differently. How will you apply what you learned to make an even greater impact?
Employee Response:
Last Fiscal Year I didn't have the need to be a Customer Solution Lead, because for me helping others to work efficiently is one of my career goals. However, some of my decisions (see below) may affect my ability to contribute to the SfMC Time Zone Utilization and have customer success story that I effectively participate.

In FY23 I was asked to work alongside some of my colleagues as their Backup Lead: Deloitte with boB Taylor (due to boB lack of CSL experience), PTC and Mastery with Omeswar Reddy Danwada (due to other DnAI team members lack of Azure PostgreSQL skills), and NYC311 with Sayeed Rizvi (due to no other volunteer available).

When I was asked there was a kind of promise from each one of the Account Leaders that I should have billable hours and real tasks to work on. However, I ended up with a little billable hour, and nearly zero tasks. The main reason was very low workload requests/demand, and some SfMC Solution Hours restriction due to contract burn rate.

For those reasons, I will need to change my approach and think more about volunteering for this kind of request, while I am waiting to be assigned as a Customer Solution Lead.

Core priorities

Prompt:
What impact did you have for each of your core priorities?
Employee Response:
In 2023 I turned ten years working for Microsoft, and I reflected on my colleagues' HR feedback to reevaluate whether my philosophy is still connected to the company's mission. I am thrilled to say that it's still connected, and this is why it keeps me motivated to wake up every day and work for Microsoft.


Personal Philosophy

"I am helping people as much as possible, preparing them to work efficiently and independently."

- Alex Rosa


 

Create value by accelerating consumption of solutions and support.
 

Individual Accomplishment:
In the last period, I continued to develop my relationship with our customers with over than 70% of utilization time and I accepted some challenges, taking Deloitte and Wolters Kluwer as their new Azure SQL Workload Lead: CIBC (26% of my billable/utilization impact), JPMC (21%), MGB (16%), Wolters Kluwer (13%), and others (please, see OverallMetrics.pdf attached for more details).

As a bonus, I had a direct impact on MGB Customer Success Story (SQL Server stability increased), an indirect impact on Mattress Firm Customer Success Story (Labor Day Sale Event new record), and a direct impact on Scotiabank deliverables (Azure SQL High Availability increased), (please, see Customer files attached for more details).
Impact:
Partners Healthcare (MGB) SQL Server environment was finally in a stable state with no incidents for more than 12 months after all proactive services were delivered. The Proactive Services delivered were chosen based on the customers' needs, making sure we added value to their business.


Contributing to the Success of Others:
The nineteen colleagues' HR feedback from a variety of colleagues, including DTU Manager, CSAM, and CSA, across different Microsoft teams, gives life to my contribution to the success of others. I created a Cloud Word (see file attached) including all feedback, and the word "HELP," meaning the times I helped my colleagues somehow, is the most mentioned in each feedback.

The CSAMs official feedbacks is a clear example that I worked closely with them achieving more than the expected results.

Impact:
One Microsoft approach with an excellent relationship with many CSAMs and CSA-Es by consequence help them to achieve their commitments.

 

 

Leveraging Others Work:
For Wolters Kluwer I reached out to boB Taylor asking him to share with me his experience about "T-SQL Patterns and Practices Review" offering, and after understanding the offering details I asked him if he could deliver it to WK, and he agreed.

Impact:
During the scoping call, Michael Johnson (WK Product Software Engineering Manager), told us how satisfied he is with this offer that may uncover blind spots in their SQL code, and with the recommendations their applications will have better performance.

 

 

Deliver an easy & connected experience.
 

Individual Accomplishment:
I have participated in most of the Discovery Assessments (more than ten during the past twelve months), collecting information and updating SfMC Know-Me with the key points required to SfMC and CSS support our customers.

Investing time doing reactive cases review and working on RCA Completion (fourteen completed with SLA met, four missed because they were assigned to me during my vacation).
Impact:

The Know-Me information gives us a unique opportunity to show to our customers that we know their environment and we are connected to them.

The time invested in RCA helped me to understand trending issues and identify recommendations that could add value to our customers.
 

 

Contributing to the Success of Others:

I have transitioned JPMC and MGB to Supatra and Anya after two months of internal sync calls, hundreds of internal messages answering their questions and clarifying all points they needed.

Impact:
The SfMC CSA-Es were able to start working with the customers easily due to the smooth transition without impacting the customer experience side.

 

 

Build trust through customer centricity & technical capability.
 

Individual Accomplishment:
My WK's role success was achieved by applying insightful listening skills, asking the right questions as needed, and high-level technology expertise, all possible by completing my required training and more.
I'm completing the Value Based Deliver (VBD) "Migrate SQL Server to Azure SQL MI and IaaS" (Level 200 earned in April 2023, Level 400 ETA May 2023).
Also, I renewed some of my technical certifications such as: Azure Data Engineer, and Azure SQL Database Administrator.
Impact:
With my technical and professional training, especially those related to communications, WK team is confident and comfortable to ask me any kind of technical questions, and I am glad to say that I have become a Trusted Advisor in a brief time based on Carolyn Ragland (WK Data Director), Karen Feagler (CSAM), and my SfMC V-Team feedbacks.


 

Contributing to the Success of Others:
My SfMC CoE Americas Lead position allowed me to work on important initiatives, such as Discovery Assessment Questionnaire and Monthly Technical Presentations, for our SfMC Data & AI global team.
Impact:
The CoE initiatives help SfMC global CSA-Es standardizing our SfMC assessments, linking SfMC Know-Me with our internal tools like Azure Support Center. The technical presentations cover the main technical topics our team asked for in the beginning of the fiscal year, improving their technical skills and helping them to deliver a better experience to our customers.


 

Leveraging Others Work:
Reading the customer success stories that my colleagues publish helps me learn new ways to deliver similar results to my customers.

Also, the HR feedback tool, watching technical and professional presentations, and talking to my colleagues gave me new ideas, such as: how to bring value to the customer, how to be more proactive vs. just responding to their requests, using a whiteboard to explain specific points and others.

Impact:
For WK, being more proactive rather than just responding to their requests gave us the opportunity to offer a Deep SQL Troubleshooting training already approved for the next contract term starting on June 2023.
 

 

Personally, commit to generate and protect Microsoft trust by living Microsoft’s values, culture, and Trust Code in every decision.
 

Individual Accomplishment:
Completed 100% of training on time and achieved 100% compliance for on-time labor logging.

Also, I have completed extra training (not mandatory). My Viva Learning has about 168 training courses completed.

Impact:
By modelling integrity, I lead by example to my colleagues, and ensure Microsoft is protected through ethical behavior and compliance in everything we do.

What impact did your actions have in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive Microsoft?
Employee Response:
After completing some of the D&I Learning Pathways training, I have decided to volunteer to organize the most important Hispanic and Latinx event of the year, HOLA Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month Celebration and I was selected to be one of the six sessions coordinators, and I am leading the session "Leading with Latinidad (Panel)" (please see files attached for role responsibilities).

In this session, I invite high-level Microsoft executives like General Country Managers and Vice-Presidents to join us in a panel of four speakers and two facilitators sharing their inspirational stories about leveraging allyship and cultural strengths to dream big and lead with latinidad.

The impact and contributions to the success of others are enormous because the worldwide Hispanic/Latinx audience will have the opportunity to hear real and inspirational success stories and how they can achieve that as well.

Congratulations on 10 Years - what an incredible milestone, and we're so fortunate to have you on the team.

 

Alex, you've had a great year in FY23 as the Workload Lead for CIBC and Wolters Kluwer, as well as previously the CSL for JPMC and Scotiabank. You've also received some incredible feedback from your peers, including:

 I really appreciate all the leadership and initiative that Alex has taken this past year. He has been a key contributor to the SfMC SQL America's team.
 Working with you, Alex, as SfMC SQL Tech Lead and in Data and AI CoE has been an absolute pleasure. I have noticed that you have an abundance of resources and expertise in various processes and procedures, and I have personally benefited greatly from your knowledge.
 Alex is extremely helpful and ready to share the best practices. For example, Alex explained to me in detail about the best way to get Customer’s Azure information for KnowMe. Alex works towards win-win scenarios and is always ready to help. Alex is easy to work with.
 

In addition to the impact you've made on your customers, it is also important to ensure we're maintaining our delivery excellence. It doesn't just matter what you do, but also matters how you get there. Some insights on those, include:

Service Activations: 100%
Know Me: 100%
RCA: 77.8% Completed On-Time
MCST Burn Rate: 126.4% for CIBC and 144.1% for WK
Contribution to Time Zone Utilization: 72.9%
Training: 100%
Labor Logging: 100%
Customer Success Story: 2 Published
 

I appreciated you taking the time to reflect on your year. You've demonstrated the great impact you've made on each core priority, with Microsoft's three circles of impact. Some highlights from your reflections that stood out to me:

You are seen as a leader in this organization, and you've proven that with all the mentoring and coaching you've done with your peers. I especially appreciated you diligently helping Supatra and Anya as they ramped up - being new in role. I would like to fully acknowledge that it is because of you that we had such a smooth transition, and Supatra is now making great impact on the account.
Thank you for delivering all those Discovery Assessments, and investing your time to complete the RCAs. I appreciate your dedication in completing them, and more importantly, completing them on time.
You continue to impress by leading the SfMC CoE ATZ SQL team and find ways to improve our business. You already know how to make great individual accomplishments, and now you're helping others be successful too.
 

Lastly, you continue to impress me as you share valuable content and knowledge within our team. Thank you for all that you've done this year!

Growth mindset is about learning from our mistakes and setbacks to enable our future growth. It's important that we learn and adapt quickly. Then, we can apply what we’ve learned so we can continually grow and deliver greater impact for our teams, customers, and business.
Prompt:
Consider when you could have done something differently. How will you apply what you learned to make an even greater impact?
Employee Response:
In my last connect, I mentioned the importance of listening skills. Communication is still a challenge, in the past 10 months, 35% of my utilization time has come from internal and external meetings (please see OverallMetrics.pdf attached), what represents 618 hours listening and talking to people. It's more than any other categories, and higher than most of them combined.

I still feel that I need to improve my English language skills even more, and possibly reduce the number of meetings I am attending.

Based on Viva Insights Meeting Habits, I was multi-tasking 12% of the meetings I have attended, that means I didn't have my full attention on the meeting. Last year, one of my customers asked me to repeat what he said. Luckily, it was not one of the 12% moments that I was multi-tasking, and I was paying attention, so I was able to repeat exactly what he said, but that rang a bell for me.

So, I am improving my English vocabulary, words pronunciation, reading specific books, taking courses, to improve my communication skills in a high-level as I have my technical skills.

Alex – Through this last period, you continued to build upon the relationships you have developed with your customers at MGB, JPMC, and CIBC. By leveraging these relationships and working with the teams in place with these customers from other technical areas, you have been able to show increasing impact by not only meeting the customers' needs but also helping to lead by example on many occasions.

There are several factors that go into successful engagements within SfMC, including maintaining a high-quality delivery along with maintaining consistent contribution to delivered hours. Here are some insights:
Required Training Completed: 100%
Labor Logging Compliance: 106.7%
Contribution to the Time Zone Utilization Target: 74.6%
Service Activation: Completed - 1 (JPMC), Delayed - 1 (Scotiabank)
RCA Completion: 5 Completed (1 Pending Engineering)
* Bonus – MGB Customer Success Story Published
During this past period, you have maintained a healthy amount of delivered hours for your customers while remaining on-top of your required tasks of completing RCAs, and Service Activations. In addition, you went the extra mile to pursue and publish a Customer Success Story with your colleague for MGB (Partners Healthcare). Not only does this highlight your ability to develop and execute a plan to help out a customer, but also share this success with the team to allow others to learn from your successes.

This past period, you have made progress learning new technologies as well by taking on some customers and trainings around Cosmos DB and are diving into Databricks. As customers continue to dive more deeply into data analytics, harnessing this data and having the skills to be able to assist in the big data field will be critical. This will allow you to learn from the existing team of CSA-Es delivering in these areas today but also allow you to explore additional solutions and VBDs for customers looking to expand into this area.

In addition to your customer work, you have taken on the role of leading the SQL v-team. Taking on this role will give you the opportunity to set the tone with the SQL CSA-Es within SfMC and allow you to show your leadership by ensuring all team members understand how to successfully deliver to a Support for Mission Critical Customer while bringing training opportunities to the team. You’ll also be able to play a critical role in developing additional relationships with the Product Team to ensure V-Team concerns are heard and communicated effectively. Lastly – by leading the V-Team, you’ll have the ability to shape the readiness of the team and ensure we have the skills needed as an org to meet the changing needs of the customer.

Finally – Thank you for assisting onboarding and being a great mentor to our new teammates! This is a great way to contribute to their success and the effectiveness of the team. You not only assist with your new teammates as a mentor, but often offer up assistance to others outside of your technology to ensure a good experience for all new joiners to SfMC.

While on Aaron's team, you have made efforts to ensure people participated in “This is us” and other events such as coffee time to increase everyone’s knowledge of each other (increasing D&I). I hope this is something you continue to do as you join your new team for the rest of the fiscal year. You were one of the first to be on camera and consistently encouraged others to do the same. You often shared your experiences and stories to make others feel more welcome. Thank you for helping create a sense of community within SfMC and within the team.

Lessons Learned:
I have learned that as a technical leader, listening is crucial, especially insightful listening, but with SfMC we have internal meetings when some of the CSA-Es talks more than others. If I am listening, so not interrupting them, sometimes it may look like that a lack confidence or not having technical skills, what is not the case.

How to apply:
Find the balance between being a listener and being more vocal in our internal calls. Politely asking to share my thoughts making sure I am being clear. Last month, I bought the book recommended by Satya Nadella, "Do I Make Myself Clear", to improve my messages.

Manager comments
I agree with your assessment about technical leadership and taking an active listening role. By offering up solutions without fully understanding the customer’s situation or the objectives of the other resources engaged, we can often find ourselves in a position where it is difficult to make progress. By delivering a sharper, more precise message which addresses the concerns of all of those involved, you will gain the buy-in of internal team members and customer stakeholders. As a SfMC Customer Solution Lead and Workload lead, we are often dependent upon others to ensure we are successful within our role and by having a deep understanding of the SfMC value proposition and the objectives of all involved, we can increase the amount of impact we have within our accounts.

To that end, continue to be mindful of the information we provide to the customer to ensure we are working as One Microsoft. Taking ownership of issues and ensuring the customer sees a unified front continues to be critical to the work we do. By making every interaction focus on how SfMC is helping the customer solve their problem, we will be able to ensure they view you as the trusted advisor and the contact who truly “knows” their solution.

Lastly – while continuing to expand into the big data space, make sure to give yourself the time required to practice and absorb all of the nuance of the technology. Seek out additional opportunities to deliver VBDs/MIP for customer as you learn more about a given big data technology. Try to choose 1-2 fields you want to study and develop a plan to deliver a specific workshop to ensure you have developed depth of knowledge and to allow you to deliver impact to our customers with these newfound skills.
